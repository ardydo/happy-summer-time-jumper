This game started as a submission for Global Game Jam, even though I was frustrated that I wasn't able to attend in any of the local gatherings, I started a supposed pirate game for it. I wasn't able to finish it in time, but I still wanted to finish. It turned out pretty simple, but at least, it's still something.
As usual, if you feel like learning how I have implemented some of those things, my games are always open source, and you're free to consult and use it for stuff. If you could give me some credit or at least a shout out, it would be awesome.
